# TBSGame
Simple turn-based strategy game.



This project was made for a summer homework (sort of) for school.
I used this to learn more about handling 2D tiles

How to play:
1. Open map.YFY in /map
2. Create units at towns.
3. To move an unit, type it's neighbouring coordinates in the text boxes
4. Destroy the enemy town to win (the test map has its HP set to 1)
